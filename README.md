# HashTable
Hash table implementation

Lab Requirements:

n this lab you will implement a hash table with linear probing and perform simulationsto observe its performance.  The hash table will store integers.  The hash function to beused ish(x) =x%M(the remainder after dividingxbyM), whereMis the size of thehash table.  The set of possible keysxis the set of positive integers representable by theintdata type.  You must write aJavaclassHashTableLinand a classTestHashTablefor testing and for measuring its performance.
